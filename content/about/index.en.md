I'm Deepak Yadav — a QA engineer focused on building reliable, scalable, and testable software systems.

My work centers on:

- Web and API automation (Selenium + Java, Rest Assured)
- Performance engineering with JMeter
- Test strategy design for complex releases
- CI/CD-driven quality pipelines
- Root-cause debugging using DevTools, logs, SQL, and profiling
- Designing frameworks for long-term maintainability

This blog exists to turn real engineering problems into repeatable, practical solutions.  
The focus is intentionally narrow:

- Automation patterns that actually scale  
- API testing workflows that uncover real defects  
- Performance scenarios that reflect real user behavior  
- SQL and debugging techniques for faster triage  
- Clean explanations of test frameworks and QA leadership decisions  
- Mistakes worth avoiding in real-world projects  

If you're a QA engineer, SDET, or someone who wants pragmatic answers instead of theory, you’ll find value here.
