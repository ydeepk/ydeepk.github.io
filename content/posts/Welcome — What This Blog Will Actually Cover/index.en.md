Most QA content online is either too theoretical or too shallow. This blog exists to fix that.

The goal here is simple:  
**Share solutions that come from real engineering work, not copy-paste tutorials.**

Over time, I’ll document the exact workflows, debugging steps, tools, and strategies that consistently produce better test coverage and faster problem resolution.

## What This Blog Will Focus On

### 1. Web Automation (Selenium + Java)
- Clean, maintainable automation patterns  
- Page objects that don’t become unmanageable  
- Handling dynamic DOM, waits, sync issues  
- Running tests reliably in CI/CD

### 2. API Testing (Rest Assured + Postman)
- Practical API automation design  
- Organizing large test suites  
- Request chaining, payload design, schema validation  
- Common API defects and how to expose them quickly

### 3. Performance Engineering (JMeter)
- Realistic load models  
- Avoiding synthetic, useless scripts  
- Performance debugging (servers, DB, network)  
- JMeter data design + monitoring setup

### 4. Debugging & Tools
- DevTools for network + performance issues  
- SQL for data validation and triage  
- Logging, tracing, and root-cause workflows  
- Test environment readiness checks

### 5. QA Strategy & Decision-Making
- Test planning that fits agile teams  
- Knowing what not to automate  
- How to prioritize defects  
- Reducing flaky tests with process changes

## What You Won’t Find Here
- Motivational quotes  
- Generic “what is automation” content  
- Copy-pasted examples from documentation  
- Unnecessary theory  
- Overly fancy frameworks that break easily  

If something doesn’t work in real teams, it won’t be recommended here.

---

## Who This Blog Is For
- QA engineers who want to grow into SDETs  
- Manual testers transitioning into automation  
- Developers who want stronger quality practices  
- Anyone tired of tutorials that ignore real-world constraints

---

## What’s Next
Over the coming weeks, I’ll publish:

- A clean Selenium + Java framework breakdown  
- API automation structure that scales  
- JMeter session-based performance model  
- Practical SQL notes for QA engineers  
- Templates for test strategy and quality plans

If you find this useful, share it with someone who prefers practicality over complexity.

Welcome to **Break It Better**.  
Let’s get to work.
