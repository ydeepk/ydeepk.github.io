# The Time Project
1. Basic Clock [ choose option 24 / 12 hour, location based, zone wise ]
2. World Clock
3. Full date
4. Alarm Clock

/*

World clock Easy
What time is it in Tokyo? London? Sydney? Try making a wall of clocks, like a newsroom, that shows the time in different cities around the world. Try creating new functions that add or subtract hours from your current time.

Full date Medium
Showing the time is great, but letâ€™s see if we can use all that date information. See if you can use methods like getDay, getDate, getMonth, and getYear to make a daily calendar display.

Alarm Clock Hard
Put your clock to work. See if you can make your clock do something attention getting, like change the background to eye catching color or an animated gif, when a certain time is reached.

function displayTime() {
    var meridiem = "AM";
    var currentTime = new Date();
    var hours = currentTime.getHours();
    var minutes = currentTime.getMinutes();
    var seconds = currentTime.getSeconds();

    // Convert from 24 hour to 12 hour format
    // and keep track of the meridiem.

    if(hours > 12) {
      hours = hours - 12;
      meridiem = "PM";
    }

    // 0 AM and 0 PM should read as 12
    if(hours === 0) {
      hours = 12;
    }

    var clockDiv = document.getElementById('clock');
    clockDiv.innerText = hours+" : "+minutes+" : "+ seconds+" "+meridiem;
}

displayTime();

setInterval(displayTime, 1000);
